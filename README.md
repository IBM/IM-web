# IM-web / element-web

IBM whitelabel Instant Messenger solution based on Element

Element (formerly known as Vector and Riot) is a Matrix web client built using the [Matrix
JS SDK](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk).

# Getting started

Element is a modular webapp built with modern ES6 and uses a Node.js build system.
Ensure you have the latest LTS version of Node.js installed.

Using `yarn` instead of `npm` is recommended. Please see the Yarn [install
guide](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) if you do not have it already.

1. Install or update `node.js` so that your `node` is at least the current recommended LTS.
1. Install `yarn` if not present already.
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/element-hq/element-web.git`.
1. Switch to the element-web directory: `cd element-web`.
1. Install the prerequisites: `yarn install`.
    - If you're using the `develop` branch, then it is recommended to set up a
      proper development environment (see [Setting up a dev
      environment](./developer_guide.md#setting-up-a-dev-environment) below). Alternatively, you
      can use <https://develop.element.io> - the continuous integration release of
      the develop branch.
1. Configure the app by copying `config.sample.json` to `config.json` and
   modifying it. See the [configuration docs](docs/config.md) for details.
1. `yarn dist` to build a tarball to deploy. Untaring this file will give
   a version-specific directory containing all the files that need to go on your
   web server.

Note that `yarn dist` is not supported on Windows, so Windows users can run `yarn build`,
which will build all the necessary files into the `webapp` directory. The version of Element
will not appear in Settings without using the dist script. You can then mount the
`webapp` directory on your web server to actually serve up the app, which is
entirely static content.

# config.json

Element supports a variety of settings to configure default servers, behaviour, themes, etc.
See the [configuration docs](docs/config.md) for more details.
